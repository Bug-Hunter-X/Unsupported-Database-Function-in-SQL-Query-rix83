This repository demonstrates a common error in SQL queries: using database-specific functions that are not supported by the target database system. The `bug.sql` file shows an incorrect usage of SQL Server's `GETDATE()` function within a PostgreSQL context. The solution in `bugSolution.sql` demonstrates how to fix this by using the standard SQL `NOW()` function or the database's equivalent.
